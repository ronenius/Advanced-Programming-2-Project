# Advanced-Programming-2-Project

The app works with react. Inside the folder "client-side-web", is the src folder. To run it, type cd to "client-side-web" and "npm start" from the terminal.
In the homepage, there is a log in page. if the login info is correct, it will link to the mainpage.
There is also a registration part, where you can register a new account, with username, password, nickname, and picture (username and nickname mustn't be empty and password must have at least 6 characters and a letter and a number). There is also an option in the registration to assign a profile picture and preview it by clicking on it.
In the main page there is a contact part, where you can search for contacts by name, and add new contacts by their username (not nickname).
There is already a user with username: "Shlomy" and password: "Shlomy123" which has 5 ready contacts in his contact part. And with each contact he shares some messages automatically, including a text message, an image, a video, a file and an audio message.
There is a log out button which links you to the login page and messages that are already sent, will not lose because we are using the react-router functions in this project.
In the chat section you can view your past messages from all kind of types and you can send messages from these types too (text messages, images, videos, files and audio recordings).
Also in the top of the chat section there is a search bar, where you can search for messages in the chat that include the characters typed in the bar.
